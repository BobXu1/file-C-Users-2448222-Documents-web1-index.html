	<h1>Bob Xu</h1>

	<p>Hello! I am Bob Xu. I was born in China and moved to Canada a year ago. One of my biggest interests is music. I have been playing the violin for 9 years and is currently in one of the school's string group. There is one video game called Minecraft that pretty much made half of my childhood. Now I still play the game but not as much as I used to. I also play other games such as PUBG and Overwatch. I am also a huge anime fan. I am currently watching season 3 of Attack on Titan. I'm very glad that I can participate in this course this year! The major reason why I chose this course is that I want to learn how computers work in general, and hopefully some basics of programming. I look forward to meeting you next week!</p>
